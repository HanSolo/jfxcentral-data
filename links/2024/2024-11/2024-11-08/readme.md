* [**Sean Phillips** shared on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/seanmiphillips_projected-volumetric-detection-method-applied-activity-7256695177157689345-2Okp/): "_Applying 3D Projected Volumetric Detection method to the Biden Robocall Deep Fake. ... Caveats to this demonstration are that this was clearly a controlled experiment and importantly is a qualitative manual process. However it is clear the potential of the method and with sufficient further development could be largely automated._"
* [JVM Weekly vol. 106 by Artur Skowroński](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/microprofile-ai-jakarta-ee-12-data-whats-new-java-jvm-skowro%C5%84ski-ihd2f/) has a section "What Does Java UI Development Look Like in 2024?" which includes, of course, JavaFX:

## JFX Central

* [Message from **Dirk Lemmermann**](https://x.com/dlemmermann/status/1853719535901122837): "_JFX Central is now available as a web app, a desktop app, and an iOS application (via Gluon). We still need to get it into the Google Play Store. Anyone up for the job? If any code changes are required I could work on that. I just need somebody to take over the deployment part to the Play Store. I do not feel at home at all in the Android space :-)_"
