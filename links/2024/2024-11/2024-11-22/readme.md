* binjr v3.20.1 is now available: "_This is an interim release which fixes a regression introduced in v3.20.0 that severely impacts the performances of the CSV and Log files adapters. Read the [full changelog and download it here](https://binjr.eu)."
  * Related to this release, [**Frederic Thevenet** shared](https://mastodon.social/@fthevenet/113469334194641331): "_I've been pretty pleased with my custom 'flickering neon sign' effect in JavaFX for the binjr logo, until the moment I realized my 12 y/o had no idea what that flickering was supposed to be! A very 'what's the color of a TV tuned to a dead channel?' moment..._"

* [**Gerrit Grunwald** shared a video](https://bsky.app/profile/hansolo.eu/post/3lb2eehtyu22q): "_And here you go... my JavaFX-based QlockTwo with support for swipinp, on a Raspberry Pi._" He isn't allowed to share the code because the design is copyrighted, but it is a piece of art to look at and a nice challenge to recreate it by yourself ;-)
* [**Jago de Vreede is looking for help](https://x.com/JagoVreede/status/1857082809355002346): "_I've created an early-access build for aarch64 binary for Mac of SKDman-UI. Unfortunately, I can't test that one because I don't have an M-MacBook. Does anyone with an M MacBook want to see if it works?_" The [early-access releases are on GitHub](https://github.com/jagodevreede/sdkman-ui/releases/tag/early-access).
