## Core

* Just a tip: keep an eye on [github.com/openjdk/mobile](https://github.com/openjdk/mobile). It's a project to bring more mobile support to the OpenJDK. This will, once integrated, make it easier to bring JavaFX to even more platforms.

## Applications

* [**BJ Dela Cruz** shared screenshots of his Flight Display application](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bj-delacruz_seattle-tacoma-international-airport-departures-activity-7254534029104844801-gJCx/): "_It can generate a list of arriving or departing flights for an airport you choose._" You can find the [sources here](https://bitbucket.org/bjpeterdelacruz/flight-display/src/main/).

## Components, Libraries, Tools

* Continued [work in progress by **Pedro Duke**](https://x.com/P_Duke/status/1847993884355277286): "_Transit Theme next release, PART 8: New LIGHT and DARK styles for Color Picker, Titled Pane and Accordion._"

## Podcasts, Videos, Books

* **Frank Delporte** published a [new interview in his "JavaFX In Action" series with **Ulas Ergin**](https://webtechie.be/post/2024-10-22-jfxinaction-ulas-ergin/). He explains how his team at Credit Europe Bank uses JavaFX for two internal applications. The first one is a developer tool. Based on the experience of building this first tool, they decided to use JavaFX to migrate an old Swing-based application. The new Java application combines the old Swing screens with new React user interfaces, all nicely styled and integrated thanks to JavaFX.
* [**Adam Bien** had a short talk with **Johan Vos** at Devoxx](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/5LhUtEDPf5E).

## Tutorials

* [**LoÃ¯c LefÃ¨vre** hopes we like](https://x.com/Loic__Lefevre/status/1848390393252987106) this post, and sure we do ;-): "_Finally finished [this post about creating native images for JavaFX applications using GraalVM](https://medium.com/db-one/building-javafx-app-native-image-with-graalvm-new-achievement-unlocked-c5e236ecf11d). There is a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/loiclefevre/javafx-native) at the end._"
  * Intro from the blog post: "_TL;DR â€” Building JavaFX application native image used to require GluonFX plugins and GluonHQ substrate VM. In this post, I show it is possible to rely on the latest GraalVM distribution only. This simplifies greatly the process but requires some challenges to be solved firstâ€¦ are you ready to read my journey?_"

## Miscellaneous

* [**Stephan Janssen** is letting AI code and control his computer](https://x.com/Stephan007/status/1848775499578794017): "_An experimental AnthropicAI Claude agent takes control of my screen, autonomously doing whatever is needed to get the job done. ... Now develops the same but using JavaFX (which it needs to install) and run ðŸ”¥ðŸ§ ._"
