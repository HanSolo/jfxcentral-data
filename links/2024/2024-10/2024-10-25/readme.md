## Core

* Just a tip: keep an eye on [github.com/openjdk/mobile](https://github.com/openjdk/mobile). It's a project to bring more mobile support to the OpenJDK. This will, once integrated, make it easier to support JavaFX on even more (mobile) platforms.
* [Azul is highlighting the removal by Oracle of the support for JavaFX in their Java 8 distributions](https://www.azul.com/blog/azul-is-here-to-help-you-with-javafx-8-changes-in-2025/) starting in 2025.

## Applications

* [**BJ Dela Cruz** shared screenshots of his Flight Display application](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bj-delacruz_seattle-tacoma-international-airport-departures-activity-7254534029104844801-gJCx/): "_It can generate a list of arriving or departing flights for an airport you choose._" You can find the [sources here](https://bitbucket.org/bjpeterdelacruz/flight-display/src/main/).

## Components, Libraries, Tools

* Continued [work in progress by **Pedro Duke**](https://x.com/P_Duke/status/1847993884355277286): "_Transit Theme next release, PART 8: New LIGHT and DARK styles for Color Picker, Titled Pane and Accordion._"
* [**Steve Hannah**, the creator of jDeploy](https://x.com/shannah78/status/1849566060644872258) published a [blog post](https://jdeploy.substack.com/p/now-you-can-deploy-your-app-as-a): "_Now you can deploy your app as a DMG. The codesign process is painful, but if you really want to deploy your app as a DMG, you can do that now. ... some developers have expressed interest being able to deploy their apps as a .dmg, since this would be more familiar to users. Some developers also have their own Apple developer account, and would prefer to sign the app themselves rather than deploy using the jDeploy certificate. ..._"

## Podcasts, Videos, Books

* **Frank Delporte** published a [new interview in his "JavaFX In Action" series with **Ulas Ergin**](https://webtechie.be/post/2024-10-22-jfxinaction-ulas-ergin/). He explains how his team at Credit Europe Bank uses JavaFX for two internal applications. The first one is a developer tool. Based on the experience of building this first tool, they decided to use JavaFX to migrate an old Swing-based application. The new Java application combines the old Swing screens with new React user interfaces, all nicely styled and integrated thanks to JavaFX.
* [**Adam Bien** had a short talk with **Johan Vos** at Devoxx](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/5LhUtEDPf5E).

## Tutorials

* [**LoÃ¯c LefÃ¨vre** hopes we like](https://x.com/Loic__Lefevre/status/1848390393252987106) this post, and sure we do ;-): "_Finally finished [this post about creating native images for JavaFX applications using GraalVM](https://medium.com/db-one/building-javafx-app-native-image-with-graalvm-new-achievement-unlocked-c5e236ecf11d). There is a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/loiclefevre/javafx-native) at the end._" Intro from the blog post: "_TL;DR â€” Building JavaFX application native image used to require GluonFX plugins and GluonHQ substrate VM. In this post, I show it is possible to rely on the latest GraalVM distribution only. This simplifies greatly the process but requires some challenges to be solved firstâ€¦ are you ready to read my journey?_"

## Miscellaneous

* [AI is coding and controlling the computer for **Stephan Janssen**](https://x.com/Stephan007/status/1848775499578794017): "_An experimental AnthropicAI Claude agent takes control of my screen, autonomously doing whatever is needed to get the job done. ... Now develops the same but using JavaFX (which it needs to install) and run ðŸ”¥ðŸ§ ._"
